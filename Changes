    [FEATURES]
    Allow cfg_files() to be called as class method. This causes
    the config file be re-used across multiple requests in a persistent
    environment.

    This is the recommended usage now to improve performance.

    Thanks to Cees Hek and CGI::Application::Plugin::TT for inspiration
    on implementing this feature.
